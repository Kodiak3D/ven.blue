          Welcome to the realm of Draconius Rex, where ancient wisdom meets modern artistry. For centuries, I have
          soared through digital landscapes, breathing life into pixels and polygons with the same passion that once
          forged mountains and carved valleys.

          My artistic journey spans both the traditional realms of 2D illustration and the cutting-edge domains of 3D
          modeling and animation. Each piece tells a story of fire and fantasy, of creatures both fearsome and
          beautiful.
